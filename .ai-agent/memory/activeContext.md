## Current Decisions and Considerations

### Recent Decisions

- **Game Architecture Completion**: Successfully implemented full game architecture with proper client-server separation
- **API Design Pattern**: RESTful API endpoints with service layer separation for maintainable code
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive TDD approach with 74 tests ensuring reliability
- **Frontend-First Development**: Focus on getting the game UI and mechanics working before backend integration (COMPLETED)
- **Dictionary Implementation**: Use provided word list as JSON file with server-side daily word selection
- **State Management**: Use React hooks and custom useGameState hook for efficient state management
- **TypeScript Type Definitions**: Exclusively use `type` instead of `interface` to prevent implicit declaration merging bugs
- **Character Exclusion**: '„Çí' (wo) character is excluded from valid game characters

### Open Questions

- **Daily Word Selection**: What algorithm to use for consistent word selection across all users?
- **Dictionary Validation**: How to efficiently validate user inputs against dictionary?
- **LINE LIFF Testing**: What's the most efficient way to test LINE integration during development?

### Design Questions for Implementation

These questions from the internal design phase need resolution during implementation:

- **Error Handling**: Processing flow for invalid word input, network errors, date change timing
- **Synchronization Issues**: Game switching at midnight, multiple tabs, offline-online transitions
- **API Idempotency**: Handling duplicate submissions and network retry scenarios
- **Game Logic Details**: Character duplicate rules, win/loss determination timing

See `systemPatterns.md#Open Questions for Future Implementation` for detailed specifications.

### Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk 1**: LINE API limitations or changes

  - Likelihood: Medium
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Regular monitoring of LINE platform updates, design with adaptability

- **Risk 2**: Word list quality and appropriateness

  - Likelihood: Medium
  - Impact: Medium
  - Mitigation: Thorough review of word list, implement filtering system

- **Risk 3**: Performance issues on mobile devices
  - Likelihood: Low
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Early performance testing, optimization of React rendering

## Development Environment

### Current Branch

- Branch: main
- Status: Game state management and API integration completed and merged (PR #11). Basic game functionality is fully working. Ready for LINE LIFF integration phase.

### Test Environment

- Local development environment active
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline operational (testing on Node.js 22.x and 24.x)
- LINE LIFF debugging tools to be configured
