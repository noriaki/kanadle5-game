# Active Context - Kanadle Game

*Last Updated: 2025-05-02*

## Current Focus

Initial project setup and planning phase, focusing on defining the architecture and preparing the development environment for the Kanadle Game, a Japanese hiragana version of Wordle as a LINE Mini App.

### Active Development Tasks

- **Task 1**: Project structure setup and Next.js installation
  - Status: Ready to start
  - Priority: High
  - Notes: Need to configure for TypeScript and Tailwind CSS

- **Task 2**: Define initial component architecture
  - Status: Ready to start
  - Priority: High
  - Notes: Create core game components, state management, and layouts

- **Task 3**: Implement basic game logic
  - Status: Not started
  - Priority: High
  - Notes: Focus on core word matching and feedback mechanisms

## Recent Changes

### Code Changes

- 2025-05-02: Project brief added to memory files
- 2025-05-02: Technical stack defined
- 2025-05-02: Word list imported for game dictionary

### Architecture Decisions

- 2025-05-02: Next.js App Router architecture selected for frontend
- 2025-05-02: Vercel KV chosen as primary database for its simplicity and integration
- 2025-05-02: Mobile-first UI approach confirmed with Tailwind CSS

### Requirement Changes

- No changes yet - initial requirements documented

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Tasks

1. Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
2. Set up project repository structure and code organization
3. Create initial game board component and layout
4. Implement hiragana keyboard component
5. Develop core game logic module

### Upcoming Milestones

- **Milestone 1**: Basic game functionality working locally (Target: Week 1)
- **Milestone 2**: LINE LIFF integration and authentication (Target: Week 2)
- **Milestone 3**: Data persistence and user statistics (Target: Week 3)
- **Milestone 4**: Deployment and testing (Target: Week 4)

## Current Decisions and Considerations

### Recent Decisions

- **Frontend-First Development**: Focus on getting the game UI and mechanics working before backend integration
- **Dictionary Implementation**: Use provided word list as JSON file with server-side daily word selection
- **State Management**: Use React Context API for global state instead of more complex solutions

### Open Questions

- **Daily Word Selection**: What algorithm to use for consistent word selection across all users?
- **Dictionary Validation**: How to efficiently validate user inputs against dictionary?
- **LINE LIFF Testing**: What's the most efficient way to test LINE integration during development?

### Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk 1**: LINE API limitations or changes
  - Likelihood: Medium
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Regular monitoring of LINE platform updates, design with adaptability

- **Risk 2**: Word list quality and appropriateness
  - Likelihood: Medium
  - Impact: Medium
  - Mitigation: Thorough review of word list, implement filtering system

- **Risk 3**: Performance issues on mobile devices
  - Likelihood: Low
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Early performance testing, optimization of React rendering

## Development Environment

### Current Branch

- Branch: main (initial setup)
- Based on: N/A (new project)
- Status: Ready for initial commit

### Test Environment

- Local development environment only at this stage
- LINE LIFF debugging tools to be configured

## Communication Notes

- 2025-05-02: Project brief reviewed and approved
- 2025-05-02: Technical stack decisions finalized
