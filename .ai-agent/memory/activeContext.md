## Current Decisions and Considerations

### Recent Decisions

- **Feature Split Strategy**: Divided Daily Word System into GitHub Flow-compliant phases (17A, 17B, 17C) ensuring each provides complete user value and maintains production readiness
- **Redis Environment Configuration**: Complete environment isolation with devcontainer for local development/testing, GitHub Actions Redis container for CI, and separate Upstash databases for production/preview
- **Testing Strategy Enhancement**: Dual approach using Unit Tests with mocks for speed and Integration Tests with real Redis for system validation
- **Daily Word System Architecture**: Redis-based system with month-ahead pre-assignment strategy using nanoid 8-character IDs
- **Data Independence**: Word master database independent of words.json structure changes for operational flexibility
- **Redis Usage Strategy**: Upstash Redis free tier optimization with efficient key structures and minimal command usage
- **ID Generation**: nanoid with custom alphabet (0-9a-zA-Z) for 8-character word IDs ensuring uniqueness and readability
- **Game Architecture Completion**: Successfully implemented full game architecture with proper client-server separation
- **API Design Pattern**: RESTful API endpoints with service layer separation for maintainable code
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive TDD approach with 74 tests ensuring reliability
- **Frontend-First Development**: Focus on getting the game UI and mechanics working before backend integration (COMPLETED)
- **Dictionary Implementation**: Use provided word list as JSON file with server-side daily word selection
- **State Management**: Use React hooks and custom useGameState hook for efficient state management
- **TypeScript Type Definitions**: Exclusively use `type` instead of `interface` to prevent implicit declaration merging bugs
- **Character Exclusion**: 'を' (wo) character is excluded from valid game characters

### Open Questions

- **Monthly Maintenance Automation**: Should word assignment be fully automated or require manual trigger for quality control?
- **LINE LIFF Testing**: What's the most efficient way to test LINE integration during development?

### Design Questions for Implementation

These questions from the internal design phase need resolution during implementation:

- **Error Handling**: Processing flow for invalid word input, network errors, date change timing
- **Synchronization Issues**: Game switching at midnight, multiple tabs, offline-online transitions
- **API Idempotency**: Handling duplicate submissions and network retry scenarios
- **Game Logic Details**: Character duplicate rules, win/loss determination timing

See `systemPatterns.md#Open Questions for Future Implementation` for detailed specifications.

### Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk 1**: LINE API limitations or changes

  - Likelihood: Medium
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Regular monitoring of LINE platform updates, design with adaptability

- **Risk 2**: Word list quality and appropriateness

  - Likelihood: Medium
  - Impact: Medium
  - Mitigation: Thorough review of word list, implement filtering system

- **Risk 3**: Performance issues on mobile devices
  - Likelihood: Low
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Early performance testing, optimization of React rendering

## Development Environment
