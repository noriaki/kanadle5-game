## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js LTS (v22+ or v24+)
- pnpm (package manager)
- Git
- LINE Developer account (for LIFF integration)
- Vercel account (for deployment)

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`
3. Set up environment variables for local development (copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`)
4. Run the development server with `pnpm dev`
5. Run tests with `pnpm test` or `pnpm test:watch` for watch mode

### Environment Configuration

```env
# LINE LIFF Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_LIFF_ID=your-liff-id
LIFF_CHANNEL_ID=your-channel-id
LIFF_CHANNEL_SECRET=your-channel-secret

# Database Configuration
VERCEL_KV_URL=your-vercel-kv-url
VERCEL_KV_REST_API_TOKEN=your-vercel-kv-token

# Game Configuration
DAILY_WORD_REFRESH_TIME=00:00:00 # Japan time
```

### Local Development Workflow

1. Start the development server
2. Test with LINE LIFF Simulator for LINE-specific features
3. Use browser developer tools for debugging
4. Implement features and run tests locally
5. Commit changes and push to GitHub for deployment

## External Dependencies

### APIs

- **LINE LIFF API**:

  - Purpose: Integration with LINE for mini app functionality
  - Documentation: <https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/>
  - Authentication: LIFF ID, Channel ID, Channel Secret
  - Rate Limits: Standard LINE API rate limits
  - Environment Variables: NEXT_PUBLIC_LIFF_ID, LIFF_CHANNEL_ID, LIFF_CHANNEL_SECRET

- **LINE Login API**:
  - Purpose: User authentication
  - Documentation: <https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-login/>
  - Authentication: Same as LIFF
  - Rate Limits: Standard LINE API rate limits
  - Environment Variables: Same as LIFF

### Libraries and Packages

- **@line/liff**:

  - Purpose: LINE Front-end Framework SDK
  - Documentation: <https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff-api/>
  - Version: Latest stable
  - Notes: Required for LINE Mini App functionality

- **@vercel/kv**:
  - Purpose: Redis-compatible key-value database
  - Documentation: <https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv>
  - Version: Latest stable
  - Notes: Used for storing game state, user data, and daily words

## Technical Constraints

- Must comply with LINE Mini App specifications and guidelines
- Mobile-first design required for optimal LINE experience
- Maximum response time for API calls should be under 1 second
- Must support all browsers compatible with LINE LIFF
- Resource usage must stay within Vercel free/paid plan limitations
- TypeScript strict mode enabled - use `type` aliases instead of `interface` to prevent implicit declaration merging

## Deployment Process

### Environments

- **Development**:

  - URL: [Generated by Vercel per-branch]
  - Deployment Process: Automatic deployment from feature branches
  - Access: Development team only

- **Staging**:

  - URL: [kanadle5-staging.vercel.app]
  - Deployment Process: Automatic deployment from main branch
  - Access: Development team and testers

- **Production**:
  - URL: [kanadle5.vercel.app]
  - Deployment Process: Manual promotion from staging
  - Access: Public via LINE

### Deployment Checklist

- All tests passing
- Performance audit completed
- Security checks passed
- LINE LIFF configuration verified
- Database migrations applied if needed
- Accessibility requirements met

## Performance Benchmarks

- Initial load time under 3 seconds
- Time-to-interactive under 4 seconds
- API response time under 500ms
- Core Web Vitals metrics meeting "Good" thresholds

## Security Requirements

- Secure LINE authentication implementation
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF)
- No sensitive data stored in client-side storage
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Data validation for all user inputs

## Game-Specific Technical Details

### Word List Implementation

- âœ… Word list stored as JSON in the codebase with TypeScript type definitions (WordEntry[])
- âœ… Word validation against dictionary implemented for player submissions
- ðŸ“‹ Daily word selection algorithm uses date as seed for consistent selection (mock implementation active)
- ðŸ“‹ Additional copy in database for persistence (pending Vercel KV integration)

### Hiragana Input System

- âœ… Custom on-screen keyboard for hiragana input (HiraganaKeyboard component)
- âœ… Color-coding of keyboard keys based on guess results with comprehensive feedback
- âœ… Input validation to ensure only basic hiragana characters (excluding 'ã‚’')
- âœ… Mobile-optimized 5-row layout with accessibility features

### Game State Management

- âœ… Game state managed with custom useGameState React hook for client-side gameplay
- âœ… Complete state management including input, attempts, game status, and error handling
- âœ… Client-server state separation with updateClientGameState and updateServerGameState functions
- ðŸ“‹ Persistent storage in database for logged-in users (pending LINE LIFF integration)
- ðŸ“‹ Daily reset mechanism triggered at midnight Japan time (pending full getDailyWord implementation)

### Sharing Functionality
