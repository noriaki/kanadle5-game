## Design Questions for Implementation

The following design questions need to be addressed during implementation phases. See `systemPatterns.md#Open Questions for Future Implementation` for full details.

1. **Error Handling**: Processing flow for invalid word input, network errors, date change timing
2. **Synchronization Issues**: Game switching at midnight, multiple tabs, offline-online transitions  
3. **API Idempotency**: Handling duplicate submissions and network retry scenarios
4. **Game Logic Details**: Character duplicate rules, win/loss determination timing
